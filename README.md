  I build scalable solutions using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), ensuring both frontend and backend are optimized for performance.
  
- **Frameworks**:  
  I use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building dynamic user interfaces and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for robust server-side development.

- **Libraries/Tools**:  
  I implement advanced UI components with [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/) to create smooth, interactive user experiences.

- **Databases**:  
  I work with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) to handle complex data operations with efficiency and reliability.

- **Others**:  
  My development process involves using tools like Docker for containerization and Git for version control, ensuring scalability and collaboration across teams.
