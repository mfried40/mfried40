# Hi, I'm Mayer Fried! 👋

## Welcome to My GitHub Profile 🚀

I'm the IT Director at [**Score Spaces**](https://scorespaces.com), where I develop custom software solutions that help shape modern workspaces. With a deep understanding of **software engineering** and **financial management**, I’m passionate about solving complex problems and driving efficiency in the commercial furniture industry.

### What I Work With 💻

I specialize in a wide range of technologies to build impactful, efficient solutions:

- **Languages**:  
  I build scalable solutions using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), ensuring both frontend and backend are optimized for performance.
  
- **Frameworks**:  
  I use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building dynamic user interfaces and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for robust server-side development.

- **Libraries/Tools**:  
  I implement advanced UI components with [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/) to create smooth, interactive user experiences.

- **Databases**:  
  I work with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) to handle complex data operations with efficiency and reliability.

- **Others**:  
  My development process involves using tools like Docker for containerization and Git for version control, ensuring scalability and collaboration across teams.

### Featured Project 🔥
